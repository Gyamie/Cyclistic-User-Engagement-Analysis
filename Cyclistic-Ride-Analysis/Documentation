From the analysis performed, member riders make up 64.64% of the customer margin of Cyclistic company whiles casual riders’ makeup 35.36%.

## 6. Acts Phase 

As a result of the above findings, below are some of the marketing strategies that could be implemented to get casual riders to go in for annual membership packages. 
 
•	Casual riders could be educated on how cost effective going in for annual membership would be since the difference in time taken between both user groups is less like the time interval in hour, days length and period. 

•	Also, the annual prices for electric bike usage should be made cost appropriate as compared to casual rides for electric use. 

•	A discounted price could be given Saturdays to casual riders who turn to go for annual membership.

•	During Seasons like Summer and Autum where the rides are at their peak, promotion could be run to push casual riders towards annual membership since it could help them save money. 

•	The company could also leverage social media platforms to advertise the casual riders the benefits of opting for annual memberships from the above stated.
